Enhancing the SHBrowseForFolder API Function
============================================
Browse for a Folder using SHBrowseForFolder API function with a callback
function BrowseCallbackProc.

This Extends the functionality that was given in the
MSDN Knowledge Base article Q179497 "HOWTO: Select a Directory
Without the Common Dialog Control".

After reading the MSDN knowledge base article Q179378 "HOWTO: Browse for
Folders from the Current Directory", I was able to figure out how to add
a callback function that sets the starting directory and displays the
currently selected path in the "Browse For Folder" dialog.

I used VB 6.0 (SP3) to compile this code.  Should work in VB 5.0.
However, because it uses the AddressOf operator this code will not
work with versions below 5.0.

This code works in Window 95a so I assume it will work with later versions.
